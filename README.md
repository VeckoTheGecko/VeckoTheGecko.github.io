# What is this site?

Updated readmes
This is a personal webpage showing some of the projects that I have had the pleasure of working on, as well as some of the projects I have planned for the future.

# Is this it?

At the moment, the site is only a single page using HTML and CSS. In future I plan to migrate over to Next.js in order to built the site from a database of posts. This way, the content and the site itself can be separated, and the website can be expanded to more of a blog than just a page.

However, first things first, I need to learn some React, and also other projects are competing for my attention, so I won't be able to give this site the attention it deserves right away ðŸ™‚
