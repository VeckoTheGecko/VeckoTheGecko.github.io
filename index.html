      <h2>Project Showcase</h2>
      <p>
        A showcase of a few side projects I have worked on. Some projects are
        associated with GitHub repos and explanatory videos, which are linked
        where applicable.

      <h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to not only to make a program to solve
        sudokus, but also to give consideration to the style of the code. By
        coding flexibly, and in a readable manner would allow the code to be
        expanded upon if I or someone else came along at a later date and wanted
        to expand on the content. An object oriented approach was used, allowing
        for separation between algorithm logic and the view. This would allow
        alternate views to be linked up with minimal refactoring. This was also
        compared to using a function based approach. I used a backtracking
        algorithm in order to solve the sudokus. In the near future, I plan to
        implement a view using Kivy. I am also considering allowing the solver
        to also solve sudoku variants.
