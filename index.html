          Once upon a time, I stumbled accross a subreddit called
          r/happycowgifs, and I thought it would amazing to collate the top 1000
          posts into one, long "watchable" video for everyones viewing pleasure.
          <br /><br />
          A beautiful mixture of PRAW (a Reddit API wrapper to gather data),
          Requests, Pandas, and MoviePy allowed me to brew up a 4.5 hour long
          compilation. The video is complete with metadata for each GIF, and
          even a progress bar.

          The goal of this project was to not only to make a program to solve
          sudokus, but also to give consideration to the style of the code. By
          coding flexibly, and in a readable manner would allow the code to be
          expanded upon if I or someone else came along at a later date and
          wanted to expand on the content. An object oriented approach was used,
          allowing for separation between algorithm logic and the view. This
          would allow alternate views to be linked up with minimal refactoring.
          This was also compared to using a function based approach. I used a
          backtracking algorithm in order to solve the sudokus. In the near
          future, I plan to implement a view using Kivy. I am also considering
          allowing the solver to also solve sudoku variants.

          As part of my Agile Web Development unit at university, we embarked on
          a journey to create a website where people could learn morse code. The
          result that Dean Law, Jonathan Choong, and myself came up with was
          Learn Morse. A website with flashcards, minigames, and user statistics
          that guides the user through learning morse code. Although the site
          isn't hosted, the source code is available in the linked repo, and a
          tour is available in the video to the right.

          Wanting to experiment with webscraping, as well as manipulating word
          documents with Python, I embarked on the task of collating all the
          speeches and interviews done by Trump into one, readable PDF document.
          The result of which was a 5636 page PDF document complete with a cover
          page and contents page.
          <br />
          <br />
          Likewise, I similarly collated a PDF with speeches from Obama, which
          came in at 2593 pages.

          At the moment it is plain HTML and CSS, however I plan to incorperate
          Next.js and GitHub actions in order to have the HTML pages render on
          update. This will allow me to specify site content in separate files,
          allowing for maintainability.
