# Project Showcase
A showcase of a few side projects I have worked on. Some projects are
associated with GitHub repos and explanatory videos, which are linked
where applicable.


## Best of r/happycowgifs: MEGA Compilation
> Python, Pandas, MoviePy
> 
Once upon a time, I stumbled accross a subreddit called r/happycowgifs, and I thought it would amazing to collate the top 1000 posts into one, long "watchable" video for everyones viewing pleasure.

A beautiful mixture of PRAW (a Reddit API wrapper to gather data), Requests, Pandas, and MoviePy allowed me to brew up a 4.5 hour long compilation. The video is complete with metadata for each GIF, and even a progress bar.

## Sudoku Solver
> Python, OOP, Algorithms  
> 
The goal of this project was to not only to make a program to solve
sudokus, but also to give consideration to the style of the code. By
coding flexibly, and in a readable manner would allow the code to be
expanded upon if I or someone else came along at a later date and wanted
to expand on the content. An object oriented approach was used, allowing
for separation between algorithm logic and the view. This would allow
alternate views to be linked up with minimal refactoring. This was also
compared to using a function based approach. I used a backtracking
algorithm in order to solve the sudokus. In the near future, I plan to
implement a view using Kivy. I am also considering allowing the solver
to also solve sudoku variants.

## Learn Morse Code
> HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask,   

As part of my Agile Web Development unit at university, we embarked on a journey to create a website where people could learn morse code. The result that Dean Law, Jonathan Choong, and myself came up with was Learn Morse. A website with flashcards, minigames, and user statistics that guides the user through learning morse code. Although the site isn't hosted, the source code is available in the linked repo, and a tour is available in the video to the right.

## One PDF to Trump them all
> Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, docx  
> 
Wanting to experiment with webscraping, as well as manipulating word documents with Python, I embarked on the task of collating all the speeches and interviews done by Trump into one, readable PDF document. The result of which was a 5636 page PDF document complete with a cover page and contents page.

Likewise, I similarly collated a PDF with speeches from Obama, which came in at 2593 pages.

# Chopping Block
So, whatâ€™s next on the chopping block? Here is a lineup of the projects I am planning to complete over the coming months.

## Posture Recognition + Blender
> Python, OpenCV, AI  

In order to get acquainted with computer vision, I am planning to use OpenCV in Python, along with a pretrained posture recognition neural network in order to extract posture information from video. This information will then be imported into Blender, creating an animated character.


## Static Website using Next.js and GitHub
> HTML, CSS, Next.js

I would like to expand and improve this website that you are reading. At the moment it is plain HTML and CSS, however I plan to incorperate Next.js and GitHub actions in order to have the HTML pages render on update. This will allow me to specify site content in separate files, allowing for maintainability.
